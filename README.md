# Hi there! 👋 I'm [Shreeharan]!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a penultimate-year **Computer Engineering** student with a passion for developing optimized, low-latency software, building complex systems, and applying quantitative analysis to financial markets. I have experience working with various languages and technologies and am currently working on some exciting projects!

## 🚀 About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently building: 
  - A **social media clone** web app.
  - A **stock forecasting application** using **news sentiment analysis**.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently using: **Django**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**.
  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: Projects related to **low-latency systems**, **high-performance computing**, and **financial algorithms**.

- 💬 Ask me about: **C, C++, Python, Django, News Sentiment Analysis**, and **Optimized Code**.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I wrote a **compiler in C++** as part of my object-oriented programming experience!
